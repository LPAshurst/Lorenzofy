This repo houses my attempt at using the spotify API. So far I have implemented the following:

1) Connecting to Spotify via Spotipy
2) Getting the list of device id's based on my account and prompting the user to select which device they want to play music on
3) Asking the user what song they would like to hear
4) Playing said song on the selected device
